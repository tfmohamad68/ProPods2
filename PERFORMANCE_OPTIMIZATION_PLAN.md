# Performance Optimization Plan for Future Deployments

## Current Issues
- Docker builds take 10+ minutes from scratch
- No layer caching between builds
- Building entire Twenty monorepo every time (including website)
- Sequential build process

## Quick Fix Implemented âœ…
- **Fast Deploy Workflow**: Created `deploy-fast.yml` that uses official Twenty image
- **Expected time**: 2-3 minutes vs 10+ minutes
- **Usage**: Uses `twentycrm/twenty:latest` directly with custom environment variables

## Medium-term Optimizations (Future Implementation)

### 1. Pre-built Base Images (80% faster)
```dockerfile
# Create custom base image with dependencies
FROM node:22-alpine as base
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json yarn.lock ./
RUN yarn install --frozen-lockfile --production
```

### 2. Multi-layer Docker Caching
```yaml
# Add to GitHub Actions
- name: Set up Docker Buildx
  uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3
  with:
    driver-opts: |
      image=moby/buildkit:master
      network=host

- name: Build with cache
  uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
  with:
    cache-from: type=gha
    cache-to: type=gha,mode=max
```

### 3. Parallel Build Pipeline
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    component: [frontend, backend]
jobs:
  build-frontend:
    # Build frontend in parallel
  build-backend:
    # Build backend in parallel
```

### 4. Smart Deployment Triggers
```yaml
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'packages/twenty-front/**'
      - 'packages/twenty-server/**'
      - '!**/*.md'  # Ignore documentation changes
```

### 5. Registry-based Caching
- Use GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) for layer caching
- Implement cross-runner cache sharing
- Cache node_modules separately

## Long-term Optimizations

### 1. Optimized Dockerfile Structure
```dockerfile
# Dependencies layer (rarely changes)
COPY package*.json ./
RUN yarn install

# Source code layer (changes frequently)
COPY src/ ./src/
RUN yarn build
```

### 2. Build-time Optimizations
- Use `yarn install --prefer-offline`
- Implement build output caching
- Use esbuild for faster transpilation

### 3. Infrastructure Optimizations
- Use preemptible instances for cost savings
- Implement Blue/Green deployments
- Set up staging environment with faster builds

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Implemented)
- [x] Fast deploy workflow using official images
- [x] Fix website build issue in main workflow

### Phase 2: Medium-term (Next 2 weeks)
- [ ] Implement Docker layer caching
- [ ] Add path-based triggers
- [ ] Parallel component builds

### Phase 3: Long-term (Next month)
- [ ] Create optimized base images
- [ ] Implement comprehensive caching strategy
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring

## Expected Results

| Stage | Current Time | Optimized Time | Improvement |
|-------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| Current Custom Build | 10-15 minutes | - | Baseline |
| Official Image (Phase 1) | 10-15 minutes | 2-3 minutes | 80% faster |
| With Caching (Phase 2) | 10-15 minutes | 3-5 minutes | 70% faster |
| Full Optimization (Phase 3) | 10-15 minutes | 2-4 minutes | 85% faster |

## Usage Instructions

### For Immediate Fast Deployment
```bash
# Trigger fast deployment (uses official image)
git push origin main  # This now uses deploy-fast.yml

# Or manually trigger
gh workflow run "Fast Deploy to GCP (Official Image)"
```

### For Custom Builds (when needed)
```bash
# Use the original workflow for custom modifications
gh workflow run "Build and Deploy to GCP"
```

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators
- Build time from commit to deployment
- Cache hit ratio
- Docker layer reuse percentage
- Total CI/CD cost per deployment

### Tools for Monitoring
- GitHub Actions metrics
- Cloud Build performance insights
- Docker Hub/GHCR analytics
- GCP billing alerts

## Notes
- The fast deployment uses the official Twenty image, so custom code changes won't be included
- For development with custom modifications, use the original build workflow
- Consider implementing feature flags to avoid custom builds when possible
