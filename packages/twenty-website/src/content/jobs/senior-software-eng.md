## Product 

Creating a good CRM is hard because it's a balancing act. For each business, the requirements seem straightforward, yet everyone's needs are distinct. The result is a CRM that's either too basic, or one that's attempting to be a jack-of-all-trades but ending up as a master of none.

At first, Twenty looks like most CRMs you already know: you can track deals, organize contacts, manage tasks and notes. But what sets it apart is our approach to extensibility. We are building an open platform that provides the building blocks for you to solve your unique business problems.

We value universal principles and common patterns over feature lists. And Open Source is the bedrock of our approach, ensuring that Twenty evolves with its community, for its community.

## Company

Twenty is an Open Source + Public Benefits Company.

- One of the fastest growing open source project ever launched with 200+ contributors and 10k+ stars in less than 12 months
- Backed by YC and some of the best investors/founders in the world
- Operating in a the biggest market in software (CRM)
- Engineering-driven culture, with a passion for craft and quality

Android, WordPress or VSCode all lead their respective market because being Open Source is the best second-mover advantage. Our bet is that the same shift will happen to the CRM Market. And given that we're #1, we should be in a good position to take the lead. But the road ahead will be long and steep!
